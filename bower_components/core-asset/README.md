# core-asset
Fetches an asset relative to an imported document.

Use `<core-asset>` to load import-relative resources with URL-based de-duplication.
This is similar to an HTML import, except that the content of the response is not
processed in any way.

## Status

core-asset is experimental and speculative. It may be removed in favor of another
approach like core-request. Use at your own risk.
